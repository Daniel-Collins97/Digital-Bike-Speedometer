**Title:** Speeding Sensing Warning 

**Description:** Connected to Mobiles hotspot for internet connectivity. Uses Google Maps API to get the different speed limits in each area. Will get information from phones accelerometer and GPS sensor and use the information from these sensors to sound a buzzer when speed limit is exceeded. Panel of LED's, one green, one yellow, one red. Solid green light when speed is appropriate. When user gets within 4km/h of the speed limit, yellow LED flashes as a warning. When user exceeds speed limit, red LED will quickly flash to show dangerous speed.

**Equipment needed:**
* Raspberry Pi
* 3x LED's. (Red, Yellow, Green)
* Google Maps API (Code)
* Phones accelerometer data
* Phones GPS data
* Breadboard
* Wires
* Buzzer
* Internet Connectivity (Mobile's Hotspot)

**Other Practical Skills needed:** Programming, Soldering, Web Development, Wiring, Digital Electronics, API sourcing and use, Maths.
