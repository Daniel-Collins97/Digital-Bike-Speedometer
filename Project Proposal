### By Daniel Collins 20076240
**Title:** Bike Speedometer

**Description:** Hall Effect Sensor connected to an LCD screen. Hall Effect sensor to be connected to a static position on a bike near the wheel. Magnet attached to the wheel. When magnet passes the Sensor, a value of High is received by the Arduino. Code uses the wheels diameter and the amount of revolutions to determine the speed and distance travelled of the bike. Prints these values to the LCD screen.

**Equipment needed:**
* Arduino
* Hall Effect Sensor
* Magnet
* LCD screen (16x2)
* Power Source (7V-12V battery)
* Battery Connector
* 2 way switch
* Breadboard
* Wires
* Function for calculating Speed and Distance (code)

**Other Practical Skills needed:** Programming, Soldering, Web Development, Wiring, Digital Electronics, Math.
